It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.
It's the job that's never started as takes longest to finish.
All's well that ends better.
Where there's life there's hope, and need of vittles.
But in the end it's only a passing thing, this shadow; even darkness must pass.
I don’t like anything here at all.” said Frodo, “step or stone, breath or bone. Earth, air and water all seem accursed. But so our path is laid.
A hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for friendship.
The world is indeed full of peril and in it there are many dark places.
Someone else always has to carry on the story.
Deeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised.
